0. No nested queries
1. Every column will be type-def.ed only once in the entire statement, and all statements refer it by the type-def.ed name.
2. JOIN always before WHERE, no redundant conditions. All JOIN queries have atleast 1 term in predicate of the join relation.
3. Non-comp Conditions only have integers or literals on RHS, no OR in INNER JOIN
4. SELECT AGG(C), * is possible
5. All column names unique across tables (property of schema)
